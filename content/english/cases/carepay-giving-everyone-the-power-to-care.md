##### What have you done?

At CarePay I work as a Data Engineer on setting up the data platform. We ensure that all data that CarePay generates is available for analysis in an accessible form. The data we provide is used both internally at CarePay and by CarePay customers.

##### What particularly appealed to you about this project?

CarePay as a company really tries to innovate the healthcare industry by automating claims and as a Data team we have been able to think closely with our stakeholders. The focus was very much on delivering data that is directly usable for the stakeholders. As a result, we have been able to make a huge positive impact on the organization as a team.

##### What did you learn in the project?

Always make sure you have a backup of the data. That saved our data lake ;)

##### What is a special experience that has stuck with you?

The healthcare hackathon that we organized together with CorrelAid. Dozens of people were busy using their data science skills for social good, such as predicting a virus outbreak based on the mosquito population.

##### What kind of technology did you use?

Snowflake, Airflow, Kubernetes, AWS, Python, DBT, Singer.
