##### What have you done?

I am working with my team on a system that automates infrastructure for building data pipelines. We built a framework that automates our data pipelines and generates them by a metadata-driven ETL engine. This enables data to be loaded into the Nike Data Foundation platform in a consistent and reliable manner.

##### What particularly appealed to you about this project?

Creating solutions that actually ensure that companies can do their work faster and in a quality-oriented way. Everyone is driven to do what's best for the business, no matter the effort. Do the right thing!

##### What have you learned during this project?

It is almost never about the technical solution, but about understanding the users well and offering solutions that can lead to real improvements.

##### What was special to you and what did you remember the most?

A basketball game with the senior director at lunchtime.

##### What kind of technology did you use?

AWS, kubernetes, python (mainly FastAPI), golang, spark, airflow, Prometheus, Elastic.
