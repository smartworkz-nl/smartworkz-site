  to operate data-driven: This varies from essential Business Intelligence to Data
  Science and embracing the latest developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). I
  love to help individuals and groups learn to work with these technologies by developing
  several courses and workshops.'

Current technologies I extensively experiment with include Elastic Container Services and Kubernetes for orchestrating containers, Deep Learning and Machine Learning for building AI capabilities, Docker container services for developing production-ready applications comprising multiple components and AWS to use different services and large capacities from the cloud.

I am fortunate that I could turn one of my favourite activities into my job and own company. I am crazy about developing Data Driven applications, experimenting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) and have developed a background where Data Science and Data Engineering come together.

I have become a cross-disciplinary data analyst, scientist and engineer and enjoy working at the intersection of machine learning and engineering (i.e., MLOps).

I am a strong advocate for both engineering standard methodologies and the adoption of new technologies. I am excited by the challenge of building applications from the ground up, thinking out of the box and bringing the latest state-of-the-art technologies in AI/ML/DL models.

I am inspired to work in use cases involving Computer Vision (CV) for detecting and tracking objectsâ€™ motion in real time. I also work with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in developing emotion detection applications. I have experience working end-to-end on the ML lifecycle, from exploratory data analysis to model operationalization and implementation.

I enjoy staying ahead of industry trends and recommend relevant technologies and products in the areas of Analytics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science Tools, Data Engineering techniques, Software Development, MLOps, and DevOps. Given the rapid change in technology and machine learning today.
