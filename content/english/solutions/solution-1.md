**Dirty data is expensive**. Organizations believe that an average of 25 per cent of their data is inaccurate, a factor that affects the bottom line. This is well articulated in the **1-10-100 rule**: If it costs you $1 to prevent a data error, it will cost you $10 to correct it afterwards - and $100 if this error causes a problem.

**We build automated tests in your data pipeline so that no drop of dirty data can flow in.**

**Within approximately 2 weeks** we will, with the support of your domain specialists:

* build an automatic data testing framework into your existing data pipeline;
* fully program one data pipeline with automated tests;
* and provide you with all the necessary knowledge in workshops, so that you can (test) automate the rest of your data pipelines.

Our approach ensures that companies prevent data pollution at the source, namely in the data pipeline.
