## Amazon SageMaker Workshop

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. This workshop will guide you through using the numerous features of SageMaker.

You'll start by creating a SageMaker notebook instance with the required permissions. You will then interact with SageMaker via sample Jupyter notebooks, the AWS CLI, the SageMaker console, or all three. During the workshop, you'll explore various data sets, create model training jobs using SageMaker's hosted training feature, and create endpoints to serve predictions from your models using SageMaker's hosted endpoint feature.
