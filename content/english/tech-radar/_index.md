We love technology. Of course, we always want to make the right choice for our customers, but secretly it is also just fun to discuss technology. To do this - make choices and discuss - we use a tech radar - based on the idea of ThoughtWorks. It is a platform on which we inspire each other, share knowledge and remain at the forefront of innovation in a rapidly developing area.

The [Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) is a list of tools, techniques, platforms and frameworks, which we discuss one by one every 2 weeks during lunch sessions ... and then assess. If a certain framework is part of the basics and you can use it (under the right circumstances), it will be added to our **adoption** list. Or should you just keep your fingers off this and put it on **hold**? Hot items that promise a lot and that we want to explore more closely are on our **assessment** list. And technologies, which you should in any case know and perhaps try once, are on our **trial** backlog.

This way everyone at Smartworkz can see at a glance what's hot or not. And do you know what we stand for?
