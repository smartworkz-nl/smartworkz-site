##### What have you done?

I have developed a machine learning model to identify deviations in product quality for complex, large-scale industrial production. The models, ranging from neural nets to gradient boosting models, were deployed using a combination of Azure Machine Learning and Azure IoT Hub.

##### What particularly appealed to you about this project?

Large amounts of available data, quick switching to iterative implementation AND above all highly motivated visionaries as teammates made this project a lot of fun.

##### What have you learned during this project?

Being able to really focus on a deployment process from A to Z was very instructive.

##### What was a special experience for you that stayed with you?

Not really related to the project, sorry. :-) I bought a broken e-bike in a shop in Zaandam and later discovered that the battery had simply been disconnected!

##### What technology did you use?

Python, Azure Machine Learning, Azure DevOps, Azure IoT Hub, Dash, XGBoost, CatBoost, Keras.
